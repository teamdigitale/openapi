Problem:
  description: |-
    This schema describes RFC7807 Problem Details for HTTP APIs.
    The specification is intentionally flexible, and allows to adapt
    the schema adding further properties, or not enforcing any of the properties
    below.

    To make this schema safe by default, additionalProperties are forbidden though.
    In case you need them, you can either re-define Problem or extend it
    using `allOf`.
  type: object
  additionalProperties: false
  properties:
    type:
      type: string
      format: uri
      maxLength: 2048
      description: |
        An absolute URI that identifies the problem type.  When dereferenced,
        it SHOULD provide human-readable documentation for the problem type
        (e.g., using HTML).
      default: 'about:blank'
      example: 'https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc7231#section-6.6.4'
    title:
      type: string
      maxLength: 64
      pattern: '^[ -~]{0,64}$'
      description: |
        A short, summary of the problem type. Written in english and readable
        for engineers (usually not suited for non technical stakeholders and
        not localized): the expressed pattern does not support unicode characters.
      example: Service Unavailable
    status:
      type: integer
      format: int32
      description: |
        The HTTP status code generated by the origin server for this occurrence
        of the problem.
      minimum: 100
      maximum: 600
      exclusiveMaximum: true
      example: 503
    detail:
      type: string
      maxLength: 4096
      pattern: '^.{0,1024}$'
      description: |
        A human readable explanation specific to this occurrence of the
        problem. You MUST NOT expose internal informations, personal
        data or implementation details through this field.

        `detail` supports localized patterns whereas `title` pattern is only in ascii.
      example: Request took too long to complete.
    instance:
      type: string
      maxLength: 2048
      format: uri
      description: |
        An absolute URI that identifies the specific occurrence of the problem.
        It may or may not yield further information if dereferenced.
