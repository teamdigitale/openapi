Sunset:
  description:
     The Sunset HTTP response header field,
     indicates that a URI is likely to become unresponsive at a
     specified point in the future.  It also defines a sunset link
     relation type that allows linking to resources providing information
     about an upcoming resource or service sunset.

X-Content-Type-Options:
  description: |-
      The X-Content-Type-Options response HTTP header indicates
      that the MIME types advertised in the Content-Type headers should not be changed and be followed.
      Site security testers usually expect this header to be set to `nosniff`.
  schema:
    type: string
    enum:
      - "nosniff"
    example: nosniff

      url: "https://fetch.spec.whatwg.org/#x-content-type-options-header"
Cache-Control:
  description: |-
    Cache usage SHOULD be extensively detailed in the `description` property
    to avoid data leaks or the usage of stale data.
    This rule should ensure in some way that the api provider
    documented extensively the cache usage to avoid data leaks
    or usage of stale data.
    For now this ruleset tests:
    * the presence of following keywords
      in the `description`: `max-age`, `private`, `no-store`, `no-cache`.
    * that one and only one between Expires and Cache-Control is used.
    `Cache-Control` and `Expires` should not be used in conjuction,
    because `Cache-Control` overrides `Expires` when `max-age` is set.
    Instead if neither `Cache-Control` or `Expires` are set, clients MAY use euristic cache
    like described in RFC7234.
  schema:
    type: string
    pattern: >-
      [a-zA-Z0-9=;" -]{0,255}
